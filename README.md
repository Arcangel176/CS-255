Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The purpose of the DriverPass program is to enhance students’ readiness for driving exams by offering behind-the-wheel instruction and access to online practice tests that simulate real-world driving conditions. A key requirement of the system is its capability to ensure that the location in question possesses the most recent version of training materials and rules that align with local DMV regulations. Important features of the program include the ability to send push alerts, compatibility with various operating systems, and a scheduling system that enables students to effectively manage their time with driving instructors. The system is designed to be accessible on both desktop computers and mobile devices.


What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I performed a good job with the project as a whole, despite my familiarity with all of the user needs and my capacity to include them requiring some further work. I was able to take into account all of the requirements of the users. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would return to make improvements while Identifying all of the user needs in order and make sure everything would be included. Which involves identifying all user interfaces and providing the appropriate non-functional needs where necessary. To improve these revisions, going through the project step by step and rereading all of the user needs to make sure everything is included will be useful in improving. 



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Engaging in a conversation with the customer or, in this case, to review a transcript of that interaction. This approach would help in understanding the consumer’s background and their objectives regarding the product. Additionally, considering the perspective of the production personnel may prove valuable for design purposes, as it allows for an appreciation of their efforts and insights.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I concentrated on the stages of the system that an end user, administrator, or staff member would encounter. This focus was intended to enhance the efficiency of my method. Additionally, I found that working incrementally has proven to be successful for me. Keeping everything clean and in order is particularly beneficial for me after I have laid the project down for a few days. This practice allows me to quickly assess my current position in the process and determine what needs to be done next. I will continue to stay neat and organized throughout my years of analyzing and design, since if it is easier to read then it is easier to understand.
